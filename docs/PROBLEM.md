Problem statement
Read it carefully. Your build should cover every point below.

Business Context / Problem
Forecast demand by role/project and identify skill gaps, utilization risks and hiring or training options.

Objective and Scope
Build a working solution for this end-to-end workflow: Forecast demand by role/project and identify skill gaps, utilization risks and hiring or training options. The solution should expose key decisions and exceptions, preserve traceability, and produce measurable outputs. Medium complexity means multiple related entities, conditional rules, at least one exception path and meaningful evaluation metrics.

Primary Actors / Systems
Employee/candidate, manager, HR partner, IT/operations partner and system administrator

Business Workflow and Rules
1. Generate/reference master data first: Employee, Role, Skill, EmployeeSkill, Project.
2. Generate dependent transaction/event records using valid parent IDs.
3. Apply business logic: Create role/skill taxonomy and proficiency scale; create employee skill profiles with last-verified dates; define project demand by role/skill and period; generate allocations and leave; calculate capacity and utilization; create gaps and candidate actions.
4. Persist state changes as explicit records/events where relevant; do not overwrite history.
5. Generate outcomes and ground-truth labels from documented rules, not independent random assignment.

Entities and Relationships
Core entities: Employee, Role, Skill, EmployeeSkill, Project, DemandPlan, Allocation, Availability, Training, GapAnalysis. Define a primary key for every entity and foreign keys for every relationship. Document cardinality (1:1, 1:N, N:M), optional relationships, effective dates and lifecycle states. Use bridge tables for many-to-many relationships; retain event history for state changes; validate all joins. For deliberate anomaly cases, keep an issue_type/ground_truth label rather than silently corrupting unrelated rows.

ID / Nomenclature Conventions
EMP-000001; SKL-000001; PRJ-2026-000001; DEM-<project-id>-2026W01; ALLOC-2026-000001.

Synthetic Data Generation Instructions (Granular)
Step 1 — Write a data dictionary for: Employee, Role, Skill, EmployeeSkill, Project, DemandPlan, Allocation, Availability, Training, GapAnalysis. For each field specify type, required/optional, allowed values, units, uniqueness and validation rule.
Step 2 — Create parent/master tables first, then child and event tables. Apply this domain-specific generation logic: Create role/skill taxonomy and proficiency scale; create employee skill profiles with last-verified dates; define project demand by role/skill and period; generate allocations and leave; calculate capacity and utilization; create gaps and candidate actions.
Step 3 — Apply deterministic IDs and naming: EMP-000001; SKL-000001; PRJ-2026-000001; DEM-<project-id>-2026W01; ALLOC-2026-000001. Keep counters zero-padded, IDs immutable, and referenced IDs exactly consistent across files.
Step 4 — Generate the baseline volume: Generate 5,000 employees, 300 skills, 500 projects and 12 months of demand. Include skill expiry, part-time capacity, leave and overlapping allocations. Use a fixed seed (e.g. 20261022) and parameterize scale so starter and full datasets use the same generator.
Step 5 — Generate valid baseline records first, then inject labelled edge cases: Allocation exceeds availability; skill proficiency stale but treated current; demand double-counted; employee assigned to overlapping projects.
Step 6 — Calculate derived values (totals, balances, scores, statuses and dates) from source records rather than generating them independently.
Step 7 — Produce a separate ground_truth.csv/json for known anomalies, expected decisions or labels; never leak it into input features.
Step 8 — Run validation: primary-key uniqueness, foreign-key integrity, allowed enums, date ordering, arithmetic reconciliation, lifecycle transitions and duplicate checks.
Step 9 — Export CSV/JSON/SQL seed data plus README, schema/data dictionary, generator command, fixed seed, source manifest and validation summary.
Step 10 — Regenerate twice with the same seed and compare row counts/checksums to demonstrate reproducibility.

Suggested Volume and Coverage
Generate 5,000 employees, 300 skills, 500 projects and 12 months of demand. Include skill expiry, part-time capacity, leave and overlapping allocations.

Required Edge Cases / Negative Scenarios
Allocation exceeds availability; skill proficiency stale but treated current; demand double-counted; employee assigned to overlapping projects.

Validation Rules / Acceptance Criteria
Capacity reconciles by period; skill gaps are traceable to demand; utilization includes leave/part-time factors; recommendations cite assumptions.

Evaluation Focus for Generated Data
Review: (a) realistic distributions and meaningful variation; (b) consistent IDs and valid joins; (c) dependency/lifecycle consistency across entities; (d) correct derived values and reconciliation; (e) normal, boundary, failure and exception coverage; (f) separate ground truth; (g) fixed-seed reproducibility, documentation and lawful provenance.

Public Data Guidance / Lawful Use
External data is optional. If used, record source URL, dataset/version, retrieval date, license/terms, attribution, transformations and fields discarded. Use only data you are legally permitted to access and redistribute; do not bypass access controls or collect confidential/personal information. If licensing or suitability is unclear, use synthetic data and cite public reference data only for schema inspiration.
